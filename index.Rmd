# Introduction

I am currently a graduate student at the Mailman School of Public Health pursuing a degree in Biostatistics with a concentration in Theory and Methods. For the future, I am looking for a career in research, bioinformatics, or data science with a company that drives to produce the best care possible for their clients through innovation.

In my past role, I have been able to apply my engineering background to analyze large medical data sets and create an effective machine learning classifier for computer-aided diagnosis. I feel that my academic research experience and passions for technology and data have given me technical skills, interpersonal skills, as well as a driven and problem-solving mindset that I can utilize to succeed in the research industry and provide value to an employer.
